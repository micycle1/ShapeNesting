/**
 * For saebelma.nesting, the parallel curve to a polygon is not exactly what we want because at concave
 * corners of the outline there are points in the parallel curve which don't have the minimum
 * distance to <i>all</i> points of the polygon. In order to get this object, which I have termed
 * the <i>offset curve</i> we have to eliminate self-intersections of the curve.
 * 
 * The algorithm first computes the polygonized parallel curve and then removes self-intersections
 * one-by-one by the following process: We take a point on the convex hull of the polygon and check
 * the edge originating at this vertex against all following line segments (excepting consecutive
 * segments). If there is a self-intersection, we remove all line segments between the intersecting
 * segments and replace the end or start points of the intersecting segments with the point of
 * intersection. Then the process is started over. If there is no self-intersection, we go to the
 * next vertex.
 * 
 * In theory, this brute-force algorithm has a run time of <i>O</i>(<i>n</i><sup>3</sup>), but in
 * practice there aren't that many self-intersections and the run time is negligible.
