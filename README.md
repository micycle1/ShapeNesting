# nesting

Nesting algorithms for a nesting problem with the following constraints:
- The shapes to be nested are instances of a simple irregular polygon.
- The bounding geometry is a circle with a given diameter.
- The shapes have a given minimum distance to each other and the bounding geometry.
- Apart from translation the only permissible transformation of the shapes is a rotation by 180 degrees.

The motivation for this nesting problem comes from a machine for the production of carbon fiber preforms which utilizes a circular production table.

The project includes a library for basic geometrical objects and optimal-time algorithms for a variety of problems in algorithmic geometry such as the convex hull, the minimum bounding box and the smallest enclosing circle. For the nesting problem itself there are simple box and circle packing algorithms as well as more refined irregular shape nesting algorithms. The code can be run from the command line or from a simple GUI desktop app.
